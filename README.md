# Forecasting-Time-Series
SARIMA forecasting exercise based on Coca-Cola earnings dataset. For the main script `timeSeries.R` to execute properly, it must be saved in a directory alongside the source data file `coca_cola_earnings.csv` and the additional R script `FTS_functions.R` with all the sourced-in user defined functions. This supporting R script may be opened for function inspection but should not be edited.

The tutorial is divided in two parts:

* Find at least two linear time series models, using the Box-Jenkins methodology, for the quarterly earnings per share of Coca-Cola Company from the first quarter of 1983 to the third quarter of 2009. Identify the models using the entire available sample (`coca_cola_earnings.csv`)

* For the models identified in the previous step, leave the last 24 real values to compare all the models in terms of forecasting (out of sample forecasting exercise). Assess which one is the best model.
